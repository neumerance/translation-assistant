      <h1>Instant Translation Instructions</h1>
      <p>
        Instant translation projects are typically short and simple texts which should be translated in minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will receive a notification in the <strong>Open Jobs</strong> area (on the left)
        whenever an instant translation project is available.
        For instant translation projects there is no bidding process,
        the translation is assigned to you when you start translating it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click on the job name in the <strong>Open Jobs</strong> area and then click the
        <strong>Start translating button</strong>.
        Make sure the translation is delivered before the time runs out,
        otherwise the job will be released and available to other translators again.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the original text contains tokens such as %{token},
        you should leave them intact in the translation.
        You can insert tokens using this shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + [Token number].
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the translation is done, press the button <strong>Declare Complete</strong> to submit it to the client.
